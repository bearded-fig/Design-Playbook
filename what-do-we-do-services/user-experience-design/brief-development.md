  This where we carry out research based on the needs assessment and test early
  ideas with potential users through engagements and workshops.  This is also

# Brief Development

## Purpose

The purpose of brief development is to:

* To make a clear definition between the Needs Assessment which is assumption laden and filled with secondary research and to take the project forward with primary research and engagement
* Develop a realistic/achievable brief after the needs assessment is conducted - this is linked to [Problem Definition](problem-definition-with-project-leads-users-and-partners.md)
* Collect all research conducted by the various team members and assimilate it in a logical narrative with a basic plan forward
* Define the users we want to approach: (if we have users at hand then go straight to them, if not develop personas with the goal to find real users)

Note: The terms **Needs Assessment** & **Brief Development** are internal jargon used to define and separate project stages that we consider important.
