</details>

<details>

<summary>Prototyping</summary>

This stage entails evolving designs from wireframe to a buildable/testable Minimal Viable Product (MVP) which either is deployed via our dev team or Webflow, depending on complexity of the product or tool.

<summary>User journey maps</summary>

While this task can be related to Site Mapping, it includes the emotional journey and path a user would take to perform their desired tasks which may be outside of the actual usage of the product or tool being developed by us.

<details>

<summary>User testing</summary>

User testing in our context generally refers to us asking a user or potential user to physically test and assess what we have built and to confirm or deny its appropriateness and usability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Website development (Webflow)</summary>

We are able to implement some designs via webflow as testable Minimal Viable Products (MVPs), Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and sometimes as finished products based on the complexity of the product and suitablity of that application.  We will generally turn to Webflow when a Content Management System (CMS) is needed.

See more here (UI)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Wireframes (Concept designs)</summary>

These are early stage designs that are meant to be devoid of character and express the flow and intended use of a site without the user becoming distracted about aspects like branding or button shapes and sizes etc.
